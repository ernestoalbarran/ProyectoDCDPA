ICON FOLDER INDEX
----------------------------------------------
The icon files are categorized by file format, one format per directory. Some formats are single files with each icon on its own layer, while others contain one icon per file across multiple files. The formats are as follows:


*   AI (single layered file)
        The native file format of Adobe Illustrator, readable by
        a handful of other vector drawing applications. Saved 
        down the original to Illustrator CS format for maximum 
        compatibility (older versions don't support transparency)
        -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Illustrator_Artwork

*   EPS (single layered file)
        A design industry standard format readable by most
        software. Saved down to Illustrator CS EPS format
        for maximum compatibility (older versions don't 
        support transparency)
        -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulated_PostScript

    SVG (one file per icon)
        An open standard developed by the W3C, readable by 
        open source and commercial applications alike, as well
        as many web browsers. Saved to an SVG 1.0 profile for
        maximum compatibility.
        -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Svg

    XAML (one file per icon)
        A Microsoft-developed format mainly used by Microsoft
        applications and platforms. Saved to XAML WPF Canvas
        profile.
        -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xaml



* a star indicates preferred file format for usage. You're free to use any format you'd like of course, but slight quality compromises were made during the creation of the non-preferred formats.
